<h2>Musk Turtle</h2>
<p>
Sternotherus odoratus is a species of small turtle in the family Kinosternidae. The species is native to southeastern Canada and much of the Eastern United States. It is also known commonly as the common musk turtle, eastern musk turtle,[4] or stinkpot due to its ability to release a foul musky odor from scent glands on the edge of its shell, possibly to deter predation.[5] This turtle is grouped in the same family as mud turtles
